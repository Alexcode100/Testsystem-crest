### Code Review

**Date and Time:** 26-06-2024, 09:40 AM

**Comments:** During the code review, it was noted that the `fetchData` function in the JavaScript file was calling the wrong PHP file (`inserttestdata.php` instead of `fetchdata.php`). This caused CORS and 404 errors when fetching data.

Bastiaan's comment: "I noticed the function is calling `inserttestdata.php` instead of `fetchdata.php`. This is causing the CORS and 404 errors. Please correct the PHP file name in the fetch request."

The code was changed to:

```javascript
const response = await fetch('http://192.168.50.188/fetchdata.php?imei=' + imei);
```

**Result of the Change:** The errors have been resolved, and the application now fetches the data correctly as expected.

**Reference to the Commit:** Commit hash: 3e5f9a7

The feedback led to a change in the code, as seen in commit hash 3e5f9a7, where the correct PHP file is called in the `fetchData` function.
