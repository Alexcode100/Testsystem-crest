Instruction Manual: Setting Up a Daily MySQL Backup Script

 Prerequisites:
- Ensure you have MySQL installed and accessible via the command line.
- Create a MySQL configuration file with your credentials (`my.cnf`).
- Have your batch script (`backup_database.bat`) ready.

 Step 1: Create a MySQL Configuration File
1. Open Notepad or any text editor.
2. Copy and paste the following content, adjusting the values as necessary:

    ```ini
    [client]
    user=root
    password=your_password
    host=host
    ```

3. Save the file as `my.cnf` in a secure directory, e.g., `C:\secure_directory\my.cnf`.

 Step 2: Create the Batch Script
1. Open Notepad or any text editor.
2. Copy and paste the following script:

    ```batch
    @echo off
    set db_name=
    set backup_path=
    set cnf_path=

    set year=%date:~10,4%
    set month=%date:~4,2%
    set day=%date:~7,2%
    set hour=%time:~0,2%
    set minute=%time:~3,2%
    set second=%time:~6,2%

    REM Remove spaces from time
    if "%hour:~0,1%" == " " set hour=0%hour:~1,1%

    set datetime=%year%%month%%day%%hour%%minute%%second%

    mysqldump --defaults-extra-file=%cnf_path% %db_name% > "%backup_path%\%db_name%-%datetime%.sql"

    echo Backup completed: %backup_path%\%db_name%-%datetime%.sql
    ```

3. Save the file as `backup_database.bat` in a desired location, e.g., `C:\path\to\your\script\backup_database.bat`.

 Step 3: Set Up the Task in Task Scheduler

1. Open Task Scheduler:
    - Press `Windows + R`, type `taskschd.msc`, and press `Enter`.

2. Create a New Task:
    - In the Task Scheduler, click on "Create Task" on the right side.

3. General Tab:
    - Name: Enter a name for your task, e.g., "MySQL Backup Script".
    - Security Options:
        - Choose "Run whether user is logged on or not".
        - Check "Run with highest privileges".

4. Triggers Tab:
    - Click "New...".
    - Begin the task: Select "Daily".
    - Start: Set the time to `3:00:00 PM`.
    - Ensure "Repeat task every" is not set, since you want it to run only once daily.
    - Click "OK" to save the trigger.

5. Actions Tab:
    - Click "New...".
    - Action: Select "Start a program".
    - Program/script: Browse to your `backup_database.bat` file.
    - Start in (optional): Specify the directory where the script resides (optional but recommended), e.g., `C:\path\to\your\script`.
    - Click "OK" to save the action.

6. Conditions Tab:
    - Adjust any conditions as necessary (e.g., only start the task if the computer is idle).

7. Settings Tab:
    - Check "Allow task to be run on demand".
    - Check "Run task as soon as possible after a scheduled start is missed".
    - Check "If the task fails, restart every" and set an interval, e.g., 1 minute, and attempt up to 3 times.
    - Click "OK" to save the settings.

8. Finish:
    - Click "OK" to save the task.
    - You will be prompted to enter your Windows user account password. Enter the password and click "OK".

 Verifying the Task
1. Manual Run:
    - Right-click on your task in the Task Scheduler and select "Run".
    - Verify that the task runs successfully and that the backup file is created in the specified directory.

2. Check Task History:
    - In the Task Scheduler, select your task.
    - Click on the "History" tab to see the log of task executions.
    - Look for any errors or messages that indicate the taskâ€™s status.

 Conclusion
By following these steps, you can set up a scheduled task to run your MySQL backup script every day at 3 PM. Ensure that you verify the task to confirm it is working correctly.
